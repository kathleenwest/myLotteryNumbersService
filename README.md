myLotteryNumbersService: 

This is a simple WCF Data Services (Windows Communication Foundation) HOST service that accepts a user's name and age then outputs six lucky lottery numbers. The lucky numbers are based on the user's age, today's date, a random number generator, and the most frequent powerball number is 20. Note: The maximum possible PowerBall number is 69. 

You can run this in Visual Studio using the WCF Test Client or consume it however you like (ex: create a console application, web, cloud, etc.)
